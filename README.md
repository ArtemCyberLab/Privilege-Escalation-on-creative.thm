In this project, I worked on exploiting vulnerabilities on the creative.thm machine with the goal of obtaining administrator privileges. In the initial phase, I explored available web pages and forms, interacting with them using tools like curl and ffuf, which allowed me to identify hidden subdomains. Afterward, by analyzing files and utilizing wordlists, I was able to gain access to a private SSH key and use it for authentication. I then employed the john tool to crack the password, which was also successful. After gaining access, I analyzed the system and leveraged available privileges to execute commands as root using restricted commands like ping. In the final stage, I created a dynamic library to spawn a shell using the LD_PRELOAD technique, allowing me to bypass restrictions and gain full control of the system.
